      <h1>Welcome to myPod</h1>
      <p>
         Welcome to the place to show off your iPod, wherever you might be.
         Wanna join the fun? All you need is any iPod from the early classic
         iPod to the latest iPod Nano, the smallest iPod Shuffle to the largest
         iPod Video, and a digital camera. Just take a snapshot of your iPod in
         your favorite location and we'll be glad to post it on myPod. So, what
         are you waiting for?
      </p>

      <h2>Seattle, Washington</h2>
      <p>
        Me and my iPod in Seattle! You can see the
        Space Needle. You can't see the 628 coffee shops.
